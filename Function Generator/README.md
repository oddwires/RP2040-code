# Function Generator on a RP2040. #
* Features:
  * Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) Function Generator
  * Independant control of either channel through Putty terminal session over USB port
  * Dual 8 bit R-2R Digital to Analog converter
  * 1Hz => 1MHz frequency range.
  * X-Y mode for Analog clock
  * Variable output level 0=>100%
  * External, 3 digit, SPI display
  * Target device = Pico (also works on Pimoroni PGA2040)  
 
* Limitations:
  * USB serial requires Windows (10 or later)
  * Phase sync mechanism not effective at high frequencies
  * Target device must be overclocked for 1MHz operation

**Two independanty controled, phase locked, DMA channels...**
